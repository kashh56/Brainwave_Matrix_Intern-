Sales Data Analysis for Commercial Store - Task 1
=================================================

🏢 **Brainwave Matrix Internship - Task 1**
-------------------------------------------

Welcome to the **Task 1** folder of the **Brainwave Matrix Internship** repository. This task focuses on analyzing sales data from a commercial store (retail or online), with the goal of uncovering insights that can help improve the store's performance and guide decision-making.

* * *

📝 **Project Overview**
-----------------------

In this project, I have conducted a detailed **Sales Data Analysis** for a commercial store. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights into various aspects of the sales performance, such as:

*   Sales trends over time.
*   Segment and category-wise performance.
*   Geographical analysis of sales.
*   Shipping mode preferences and their impact on sales.

The analysis was conducted using **Python** and various data manipulation libraries, including **pandas** and **matplotlib**, to clean, visualize, and interpret the data. The findings aim to provide insights into sales patterns, which can be used to optimize future sales strategies.

🔧 **Technologies Used**
------------------------

*   **Python** (for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization)
*   **pandas** (for data cleaning and transformation)
*   **matplotlib / seaborn** (for data visualization)
*   **Jupyter Notebook** (for the development and execution of the analysis)
*   **Power Bi** (for the development of Dashboard)   

📊 **Power BI Dashboard Preview**

📊 **Insights & Key Findings**
------------------------------

Here are some key insights from the analysis:

*   **Home Office Segment** showed the highest average sales across all segments.
*   **New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco** had the highest number of orders.
*   **New York and Washington** states reported the highest average sales.
*   **Technology** products led the sales, particularly **phones** and **chairs** in sub-categories.
*   **Standard shipping** mode was the most popular, though **same-day shipping** saw a slight increase in sales.

For more detailed insights and visualizations, refer to the **Jupyter Notebook** and the **summary report**.

📄 **Expected Deliverables**
----------------------------

*   **Well-commented Jupyter Notebook** - explaining the step-by-step analysis and methodology.
*   **Summary Report (PDF)** - Key findings and recommendations in a structured format.
*   **Power BI Dashboard** - Visual representation of the analysis with interactive charts.
*   **Key Metrics** - Various performance metrics calculated and analyzed during the project.
